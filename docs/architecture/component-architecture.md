# Component Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the component architecture of the Little Lemon application, focusing on the organization, relationships, and responsibilities of the various components.

## Component Organization

The Little Lemon application follows a structured component organization:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/          # Shared components used across multiple features
│   │   └── Button/      # Example: Button component
│   ├── features/        # Feature-specific components
│   │   ├── About/       # About page components
│   │   ├── ChatAssistant/ # Chat assistant feature components
│   │   ├── Menu/        # Menu-related components
│   │   ├── Reservation/ # Reservation-related components
│   │   └── Testimonials/ # Testimonial components
│   └── layout/          # Layout components
│       ├── Footer/      # Footer component
│       ├── Header/      # Header component
│       ├── Hero/        # Hero section component
│       ├── MainComponent/ # Main content wrapper component
│       └── Nav/         # Navigation component
```

## Component Hierarchy

The application follows this general component hierarchy:

1. **App** (root component)
   - **Layout Components** (Header, Nav, MainComponent, Footer)
     - **Page Components** (AboutPage, MenuPage, ReservationPage, etc.)
       - **Feature Components** (Menu, Reservation, ChatAssistant, etc.)
         - **Common Components** (Button, Card, etc.)

## Mobile-First Component Design

All components in the Little Lemon application are designed with a mobile-first approach:

1. **Responsive Design**: Components adapt to different screen sizes, starting with mobile
2. **Touch Optimization**: Interactive elements are sized and positioned for touch interaction
3. **Performance Focus**: Components are optimized for performance on mobile devices
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features are progressively enhanced for larger screens

## Component Communication

Components in the application communicate through:

1. **Props**: For parent-to-child communication
2. **Context API**: For global state management
3. **Custom Hooks**: For shared stateful logic

## Component Guidelines

When developing new components:

1. **Keep components focused**: Each component should have a single responsibility
2. **Use consistent naming**: Follow the established naming conventions
3. **Maintain mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
4. **Document props**: Clearly document the props interface for each component
5. **Consider reusability**: Extract common patterns into reusable components
