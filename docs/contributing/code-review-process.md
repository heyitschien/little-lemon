# Code Review Process

## Overview

This document outlines the code review process for the Little Lemon project, ensuring code quality, consistency, and maintainability with a focus on mobile-first development.

## Code Review Goals

1. **Ensure Code Quality**: Verify that code meets our standards and best practices
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share knowledge and expertise among team members
3. **Bug Prevention**: Catch bugs and issues before they reach production
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding style and patterns
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure all code is optimized for mobile devices

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Branch Naming**:
   - Use the format: `feature/feature-name`, `bugfix/issue-description`, or `refactor/component-name`
   - Keep names concise but descriptive

2. **PR Title and Description**:
   - Title: Brief summary of changes (max 72 characters)
   - Description: Detailed explanation including:
     - What changes were made
     - Why they were made
     - How they were implemented
     - Any mobile-specific considerations
     - Related issues or tickets

3. **PR Size**:

## Review Process

### Step 1: Automated Checks

Before human review, all PRs must pass:
- Linting checks
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Mobile-specific tests
- Build verification

### Step 2: Code Review

1. **Initial Review**:
   - Reviewer examines code changes
   - Adds comments and suggestions
   - Approves, requests changes, or comments

2. **Author Response**:
   - Author addresses all comments
   - Makes requested changes
   - Responds to each comment
   - Marks resolved comments

3. **Follow-up Review**:
   - Reviewer verifies changes
   - Approves or requests further changes

### Step 3: Mobile-Specific Review

For components with mobile UI:
1. Test on mobile device emulators
2. Verify responsive behavior
3. Check touch interactions
4. Validate performance metrics

### Step 4: Approval and Merge

1. **Approval Requirements**:
   - At least one approval from a team member
   - All automated checks passing
   - All required changes addressed

2. **Merge Process**:
   - Author merges after approval
   - For complex changes, reviewer may merge
   - Auto-merge enabled for approved PRs with passing checks

## Code Review Best Practices

### For Reviewers

1. **Be Timely**: Review PRs promptly to maintain momentum
2. **Be Thorough**: Take time to understand the code and its context
3. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable feedback
4. **Be Balanced**: Note both positive aspects and areas for improvement
5. **Be Constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person
