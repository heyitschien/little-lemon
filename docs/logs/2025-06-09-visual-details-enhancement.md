# Visual Details & Consistency Enhancement Log

## Objective

Fine-tune the Little Lemon app for visual consistency and polish across all major pages. The following enhancements are organized by page flow (Home → About → Menu → Reservation → My Reservation → Cart), followed by global/UI consistency tasks and final unit testing focus.

---


## Home Page
- [x] Replace the desktop version "cart" with "BasketIcon" asset
- [x] Standardize the reservation / resverber button, primary button. Standardize that component for usability across the app.
- [ ] Ensure overall visual consistency with About/Menu/Reservation pages (header/footer alignment, typography, spacing, etc.)

## About Page
- [ ] Images should be larger on desktop view, with left/right padding aligned to header/footer for visual balance
- [ ] About section text on landing page is small/inconsistent—update to match rest of app (font size, weight, color)

## Menu Page
- [ ] Replace the word "cart" in the menu navigation with the cart icon used in the mobile header (asset in images folder)
- [ ] Add 2 more main course items to the menu module

## Reservation Page
- [ ] Align "No past reservations found." message to center (currently left-aligned); apply proper color and styling (reference cart empty state CSS)
- [ ] Add a button to each reservation card to allow editing, with a clear alert/label (for demo purposes)

## My Reservation Page
- [ ] Move the lemon chat icon to align perfectly with the right edge of the screen (fix gap between icon and edge)

## Cart/Checkout
- [ ] Update checkout logic to include delivery fee and tax in final total

## Global UI Consistency
- [ ] Make all button components consistent with the style guide and mockups (shape, color, font, spacing)
- [ ] Button component: On click, transition to green primary background with white text
- [ ] Create a single reusable button component for use across all pages
- [ ] Main focus: Consistency and strict adherence to the style guide

## Final Steps
- [ ] Complete and review all unit testing after visual/UI polish
