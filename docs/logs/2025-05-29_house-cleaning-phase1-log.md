-   **Activity**: Initial cleanup of unused components as part of House Cleaning Phase 2.
-   **Branch**: `feature/house-cleaning`
-   **Details**:
    -   The following components, identified as unused during the Phase 1 audit (see `docs/house-cleaning/phase-1-analysis-and-documentation.md`), were deleted from the codebase.
    -   The primary reason for deletion was to reduce codebase clutter, improve maintainability, and remove dead code that is no longer serving any function in the application.

-   **Deleted Components & Associated Files**:
    1.  **`IngredientSpotlight`**
        *   `src/components/IngredientSpotlight/IngredientSpotlight.jsx`
        *   `src/components/IngredientSpotlight/IngredientSpotlight.module.css`
        *   Directory `src/components/IngredientSpotlight/` removed.
        *   **Reason**: Identified as unused.
    2.  **`MenuCategorySection`**
        *   `src/components/MenuCategorySection/MenuCategorySection.jsx`
        *   `src/components/MenuCategorySection/MenuCategorySection.module.css`
        *   Directory `src/components/MenuCategorySection/` removed.
        *   **Reason**: Identified as unused.
    3.  **`Specials` & `SpecialCard`**
        *   `src/components/Specials/Specials.jsx`
        *   `src/components/Specials/Specials.module.css`
        *   `src/components/Specials/SpecialCard/SpecialCard.jsx`
        *   `src/components/Specials/SpecialCard/SpecialCard.module.css`
        *   Directories `src/components/Specials/SpecialCard/` and `src/components/Specials/` removed.
        *   **Reason**: Identified as unused.
    4.  **`Modal`**
        *   `src/components/Modal/Modal.jsx`
        *   `src/components/Modal/Modal.module.css`
        *   Directory `src/components/Modal/` removed.
        *   **Reason**: Identified as unused.
    5.  **`MenuItemCard`**
        *   `src/components/MenuItemCard/MenuItemCard.jsx`
        *   `src/components/MenuItemCard/MenuItemCard.module.css`
        *   Directory `src/components/MenuItemCard/` removed.
        *   **Reason**: Identified as unused and redundant with `OrderDeliveryCard.jsx`.

-   **Next Steps (Post-Deletion)**:
    -   User (Chien) to perform manual testing of the application to ensure no regressions were introduced by these deletions.
    -   Awaiting confirmation from user before proceeding with further house cleaning tasks.
