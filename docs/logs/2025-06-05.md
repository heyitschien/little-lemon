### Task: Fix `useReservation.test.js` Failures

*   **Time**: Approximately 18:36 PDT - 18:41 PDT
*   **Branch**: `feature/fix-usereservation-tests`
*   **Issue**: All 20 tests in `src/hooks/useReservation.test.js` were failing with the error "fetchAPI does not exist". This was due to `global.fetchAPI` and `global.submitAPI` being undefined when `vi.spyOn` was called in the `beforeEach` block.
*   **Resolution**:
    1.  Created and switched to a new branch: `feature/fix-usereservation-tests`.
    2.  Modified `src/hooks/useReservation.test.js`.
    3.  In the `beforeEach` function, explicitly defined `global.fetchAPI = vi.fn();` and `global.submitAPI = vi.fn();` before the `vi.spyOn` calls.
    4.  This ensured the mock functions existed when the tests attempted to attach spies.
*   **Outcome**: All 20 tests in `useReservation.test.js` are now passing.
*   **Commit**: `f4522c8` - "fix(test): resolve 'fetchAPI does not exist' in useReservation.test.js"
*   **Status**: Changes committed and pushed to `origin/feature/fix-usereservation-tests`.
