# Button Component Standardization Implementation

## Objective

Create a standardized button component system for the Little Lemon application to ensure visual consistency across all pages and features. This implementation will address the current inconsistencies in button styling and usage throughout the application.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Button Component
- Located at `/src/components/common/Button/Button.jsx`
- Supports primary/secondary variants
- Can render as either a button or Link component
- Has proper accessibility features (aria-labels)
- Follows project design system with proper colors, fonts, and sizing

### Identified Issues
- Inconsistent button usage across the application
- Many components create their own button styles instead of using the common Button component
- Duplicate styling definitions in multiple CSS files
- Inconsistent appearance, behavior, and accessibility
- Difficult to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhance Button Component
- Add tertiary variant (peach/pink: #FBDABB)
- Add size options (small, medium, large)
- Add icon support (left, right, icon-only)
- Ensure all variants follow the style guide

### 2. Update Button.module.css
- Standardize colors based on style guide
- Implement size variations
- Add icon positioning styles
- Ensure consistent hover/focus/active states

### 3. Migration Strategy
- Identify all custom button implementations in the codebase
- Replace custom implementations with the common Button component
- Prioritize high-visibility components:
  - MenuItemCard's addToCartButton
  - ReservationPage's navigation buttons
  - CartPage's buttons

## Key Components to Update

### High Priority
- Menu Item Card buttons
- Reservation flow navigation buttons
- Cart page buttons (checkout, clear cart, etc.)

### Medium Priority
- Chat interface buttons
- My Reservations page buttons

### Low Priority
- Admin interface buttons
- Footer links that use button styling

## Design Specifications

Based on the style guide and Figma designs:

### Colors
- Primary: #F4CE14 (Yellow) with #333333 text
- Secondary: #495E57 (Green) with #EDEFEE text
- Tertiary: #FBDABB (Peach/Pink) with #333333 text
- Disabled: #CCCCCC with #666666 text

### Typography
- Font: Karla (Sans-serif)
- Weight: 500 (Medium)
- Size: 16px (standard)

### Dimensions
- Border Radius: 16px
- Padding: 12px 24px (desktop), 10px 20px (mobile)
- Min Height: 44px (desktop), 40px (mobile)

## Testing Strategy

- Visual regression testing to ensure consistent appearance
- Accessibility testing for all button variants
- Responsive testing across device sizes
- Unit tests for button component props and rendering

## Expected Benefits

- Improved visual consistency across the application
- Easier maintenance and updates to the design system
- Better accessibility compliance
- Reduced CSS duplication
- Simplified component development
