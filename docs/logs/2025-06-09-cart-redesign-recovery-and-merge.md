# Cart Redesign Recovery and Branch Merging

## Summary
Today we successfully recovered our mobile cart redesign work that was accidentally stashed rather than committed. We recovered the stashed changes, properly committed them, and merged our feature branch through the proper branch flow (feature → staging → main).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Issue Investigation and Recovery
- Discovered that cart redesign work was stashed instead of committed
- Identified the stash containing our mobile UI improvements
- Applied the stash to recover our work
- Committed the recovered changes with proper commit messages

### 2. Code Organization
- Restored the complete mobile cart redesign with swipe functionality
- Recovered improvements to the MyReservationsPage
- Added react-icons dependency for mobile UI components
- Ensured all button component standardization files were properly tracked

### 3. Branch Management
- Committed all recovered changes to the `feature/mobile-ui-improvements` branch
- Merged `feature/mobile-ui-improvements` into `staging`
- Merged `staging` into `main`
- Pushed all branches to their remote counterparts

## Key Components Updated
- `CartPage.jsx` - Added swipe-to-remove functionality and mobile optimizations
- `CartPage.module.css` - Comprehensive mobile styling improvements
- `CartMenuSection.jsx` - Horizontal scrolling menu section for cart recommendations
- `CartMenuItemCard.jsx` - Mobile-optimized menu item cards
- `MyReservationsPage.jsx` - Improved empty state handling and mobile layout

## Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Implement unit tests for the cart functionality
- Test the mobile UI on various device sizes
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all new UI components
- Document the new mobile interaction patterns
