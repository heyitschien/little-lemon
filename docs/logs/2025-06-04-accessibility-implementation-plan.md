# Accessibility Implementation Plan Log

## Overview
Today we began implementing a comprehensive accessibility strategy for the Little Lemon mobile application. Our goal is to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and provide an inclusive experience for all users.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Set up axe Accessibility Linter**
   - Installed the axe Accessibility Linter extension in our development environment
   - Created an `axe-linter.yml` configuration file to customize linting rules

2. **Repository Management**
   - Committed accessibility documentation and linter configuration to `feature/unit-testing` branch
   - Created a new `feature/accessibility` branch for dedicated accessibility work

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Reviewed existing accessibility standards documentation
   - Identified areas for improvement based on WCAG principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)

## Next Steps
1. Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit of key components
2. Prioritize issues based on severity and impact
3. Implement fixes for high-priority accessibility issues
4. Set up automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
5. Document changes and testing results

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Finding the right tools for accessibility testing in our development environment
- **Solution**: Successfully configured axe Accessibility Linter for real-time feedback

## Notes
- Focus on mobile-specific accessibility considerations as outlined in our standards document
- Ensure all team members understand the importance of accessibility and how to use the linting tools
- Consider user testing with assistive technologies once initial improvements are implemented
