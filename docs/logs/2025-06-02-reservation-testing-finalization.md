## Session Summary: Finalizing Reservation Feature Unit Tests (2025-06-02)

This session focused on completing and stabilizing the unit tests for the Little Lemon application's reservation feature components, ensuring comprehensive coverage and proper tooling setup.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Test Suite Completion & Fixes:**
    *   Successfully finalized and fixed unit tests for:
        *   `ReservationList.jsx` (including fixes for date formatting and past reservation filtering logic).
        *   `DateTimeSelector.jsx`.
        *   `ReservationConfirmation.jsx`.
    *   All 55 tests across these components (plus `ReservationForm.jsx` and `reservationService.js`) are now passing.

2.  **Enhanced Test Coverage:**
    *   Addressed branch coverage gaps in `ReservationConfirmation.jsx` by adding specific test cases for:
        *   AM/PM time formatting (including 12 AM and 12 PM edge cases).
        *   Handling of empty/falsy date and time string inputs.
    *   Achieved **100% statement, branch, function, and line coverage** for `ReservationConfirmation.jsx`.

3.  **Coverage Reporting Workflow:**
    *   Investigated and resolved issues with HTML coverage report generation.
    *   Updated the `test` script in `package.json` to `vitest run --coverage`, ensuring that `npm test` now **always** generates and updates the coverage report.
    *   Created a `coverage/README.md` file to document how Vitest coverage reports work, how to view them, and how to ensure they are up-to-date.

4.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   The main `unit-testing-reservations-strategy.md` document was updated with advanced topics and lessons learned during the testing process.

5.  **Version Control:**
    *   All changes were committed to the `feature/unit-testing-reservation-flow` branch with a comprehensive commit message.

### Next Steps Suggested by User:

*   Move detailed progress tracking from `unit-testing-reservations-strategy.md` to dedicated log files (this document serves as the first instance of this new practice for today's work).
*   Review and organize other documentation within the `docs/testing/` directory for consistency and adherence to standards.
