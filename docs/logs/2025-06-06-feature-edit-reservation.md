## Objective

Implement the "Edit Reservation" functionality for the Little Lemon mobile application using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. This involves allowing users to modify their existing bookings through the app.

## Branch

`feature/edit-reservation`

## High-Level TDD Plan

The implementation will follow these phases:

### Phase 1: Enhance `ReservationCard.jsx` to Display All Information

*   **Goal:** Ensure "Occasion" and "Specific Requests" are displayed on each reservation card in the "My Reservations" list.
*   **TDD Cycle:**
    1.  **RED:** Write a failing test for `ReservationCard.jsx` to assert that `occasion` and `specialRequests` (or equivalent fields) are rendered when present in the reservation data.
    2.  **GREEN:** Modify `ReservationCard.jsx` to display these fields. Handle cases where fields might be empty/undefined.
    3.  **REFACTOR:** Clean up the component code for clarity and efficiency.

### Phase 2: Implement "Edit" Button and Navigation in `ReservationCard.jsx`

*   **Goal:** Add an "Edit" button to `ReservationCard.jsx`. On click, navigate the user to the booking form page, passing the necessary reservation ID or data for pre-filling.
*   **TDD Cycle:**
    1.  **RED:** Write a failing test for `ReservationCard.jsx` to:
        *   Assert the presence of an "Edit" button.
        *   Assert that clicking the "Edit" button triggers a navigation call with the correct path (e.g., `/book` or `/reservations/edit/:id`) and route state (reservation ID/data).
    2.  **GREEN:** Add the "Edit" button and implement its `onClick` handler using `react-router-dom`'s navigation capabilities.
    3.  **REFACTOR:** Clean up the component code.

### Phase 3: Adapt `ReservationForm.jsx` (or its page container) for "Edit Mode"

*   **Goal:** Enable the `ReservationForm.jsx` to operate in an "edit mode," pre-filling with existing reservation data and submitting updates to an appropriate API endpoint.
*   **TDD Cycle:**
    1.  **RED:** Write failing tests for `ReservationForm.jsx` (or its page container, e.g., `BookingPage.jsx`):
        *   Test 1: Assert that when the form is loaded in "edit mode" (e.g., via route state containing reservation data), all relevant fields (date, time, party size, name, email, phone, occasion, special requests) are correctly pre-filled, and the submit button text reflects an update action (e.g., "Update Reservation").
        *   Test 2: Assert that when the form (in "edit mode") is submitted, an update API function is called with the correct reservation ID and the (potentially modified) form data.
    2.  **GREEN:** Modify `ReservationForm.jsx`:
        *   Detect "edit mode" (e.g., by checking for reservation data in route state or props).
        *   Pre-fill form fields using the provided reservation data.
        *   Adjust submit button text for "edit mode".
        *   Implement the submit handler to differentiate between create and update actions, calling the appropriate API endpoint (`PUT` or `PATCH` for updates).
    3.  **REFACTOR:** Clean up form logic, ensure proper error handling, and provide user feedback (e.g., success messages, navigation post-update).

## Notes

*   Confirm exact field names for `occasion` and `specialRequests` in the reservation data structure.
*   Identify specific file paths for `ReservationCard.jsx`, `ReservationForm.jsx` (or `BookingPage.jsx`), and their corresponding test files.
