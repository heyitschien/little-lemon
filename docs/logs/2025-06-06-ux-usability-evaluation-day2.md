# UX Usability Evaluation - Day 2 Plan

## Summary of Day 1 (2025-06-05)

Yesterday we:
1. Created a new Git branch: `feature/ux-usability-evaluation`
2. Set up comprehensive documentation for UX evaluation including:
   - Heuristic evaluation framework
   - Mobile-adapted evaluation templates
   - Mobile-adapted problem finding templates
   - Usability testing implementation plan
   - Usability testing tracker

## Today's Goals (2025-06-06)

1. **Begin Practical Heuristic Evaluation**
   - Use the mobile-adapted templates to conduct actual evaluation of the Little Lemon mobile app's reservation feature
   - Focus on hands-on evaluation with real user interactions
   - Document usability issues found during evaluation

2. **Conduct Initial Expert Evaluation**
   - Apply Nielsen's 10 heuristics to evaluate the reservation flow
   - Document issues with appropriate severity ratings
   - Take screenshots of problematic areas for documentation

3. **Prepare for User Testing**
   - Finalize test scenarios for the reservation feature
   - Set up recording/note-taking process
   - Determine participant selection criteria

4. **Begin Documentation of Findings**
   - Start filling out the problem-finding template with initial observations
   - Rate severity of identified issues
   - Rate ease-of-fix for each issue

## Resources Needed

- Mobile device for testing
- Screen recording software
- Access to Little Lemon mobile app
- Our evaluation templates from Day 1

## Next Steps After Today

- Analyze findings from expert evaluation
- Conduct user testing with actual participants
- Compile comprehensive report with recommendations
- Prioritize issues based on severity and ease-of-fix
- Present findings to stakeholders

## Notes

Remember that heuristic evaluation is most effective when:
- Evaluating the actual user interface, not just the code
- Multiple evaluators examine the interface independently
- Findings are combined and prioritized based on impact
