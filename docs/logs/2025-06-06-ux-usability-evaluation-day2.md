# UX Usability Evaluation - Day 2 Plan

## Summary of Day 1 (2025-06-05)

Yesterday we:
1. Created a new Git branch: `feature/ux-usability-evaluation`
2. Set up comprehensive documentation for UX evaluation including:
   - Heuristic evaluation framework
   - Mobile-adapted evaluation templates
   - Mobile-adapted problem finding templates
   - Usability testing implementation plan
   - Usability testing tracker

## Today's Goals (2025-06-06)

1. **Begin Practical Heuristic Evaluation**
   - Use the mobile-adapted templates to conduct actual evaluation of the Little Lemon mobile app's reservation feature
   - Focus on hands-on evaluation with real user interactions
   - Document usability issues found during evaluation

2. **Conduct Initial Expert Evaluation**
   - Apply Nielsen's 10 heuristics to evaluate the reservation flow
   - Document issues with appropriate severity ratings
   - Take screenshots of problematic areas for documentation

3. **Prepare for User Testing**
   - Finalize test scenarios for the reservation feature
   - Set up recording/note-taking process
   - Determine participant selection criteria

4. **Begin Documentation of Findings**
   - Start filling out the problem-finding template with initial observations
   - Rate severity of identified issues
   - Rate ease-of-fix for each issue

## Resources Needed

- Mobile device for testing
- Screen recording software
- Access to Little Lemon mobile app
- Our evaluation templates from Day 1

## Next Steps After Today

- Analyze findings from expert evaluation
- Conduct user testing with actual participants
- Compile comprehensive report with recommendations
- Prioritize issues based on severity and ease-of-fix
- Present findings to stakeholders

## Heuristic Evaluation Audit - Mobile Reservation Flow (Completed)

Today's session focused on completing the heuristic evaluation for the Little Lemon mobile reservation user flow, using the `mobile-adapted-evaluation-template.md`. All 10 standard heuristics and the mobile-specific considerations were audited against the relevant codebase components (`ReservationPage.jsx`, `DateTimeSelector.jsx`, `ReservationForm.jsx`, `ReservationConfirmation.jsx`, and `hooks/useReservation.js`).

The `docs/ux-evaluation/mobile-adapted-evaluation-template.md` file has been fully populated with detailed findings, including Yes/No/NA assessments and Severity Ratings (SR) for each checklist item.

### Key Findings & Areas for Improvement:

*   **User Control and Freedom (Heuristic 3):**
    *   **SR 3 (Major):** Users cannot modify or cancel submitted reservations online. They are instructed to call the restaurant. This is a significant usability issue for self-service.
*   **Recognition Rather Than Recall (Heuristic 6) & Flexibility and Efficiency of Use (Heuristic 7):**
    *   **SR 2 (Minor):** The system does not remember details from *past, separate* reservations to facilitate quick rebooking for returning users.
    *   **SR 1 (Cosmetic/Minor):** No options for users to save preferences (e.g., default party size) for faster future bookings.
*   **Consistency and Adherence to Standards (Heuristic 4):**
    *   **SR 1 (Cosmetic/Minor):** The app employs a custom, branded visual style rather than strictly adhering to native iOS/Android visual guidelines. While internally consistent, this is a deviation from platform standards.
*   **Help and Documentation (Heuristic 10):**
    *   **SR 1 (Cosmetic/Minor):** No direct links from within the reservation flow to a broader help section or FAQ, though contextual help is provided.
*   **Mobile-Specific - Performance:**
    *   **SR 1 (Cosmetic/Minor):** Basic error handling for poor network conditions is present, but the app lacks robust offline functionality or advanced network resilience strategies.

Overall, the reservation flow is well-designed for a first-time booking, with strong error prevention, clear feedback, and a minimalist design. The most impactful improvements would focus on post-booking management (online cancellations/modifications) and features enhancing efficiency for repeat users.

## Notes

Remember that heuristic evaluation is most effective when:
- Evaluating the actual user interface, not just the code
- Multiple evaluators examine the interface independently
- Findings are combined and prioritized based on impact

## Session Updates & Finalization (Afternoon)

During the latter part of the session, we focused on finalizing the documentation and ensuring accuracy:

1.  **File Reorganization:**
    *   The primary heuristic evaluation documents (`mobile-adapted-evaluation-template.md`, `mobile-adapted-problem-finding-template.md`, and `detailed-heuristic-evaluation-analysis.md`) were moved into a new subdirectory: `/docs/ux-evaluation/usability/reservation-flow/`. This improves the organization of UX evaluation artifacts.

2.  **Problem Finding Template Corrections & Enhancements:**
    *   **Issue Correction:** A misplaced problem ("Basic error handling for poor network conditions, but not extensive offline support.") was corrected. It was initially under "Heuristic 5: Error Prevention" and was moved to its correct location under "Mobile-Specific Issues > Performance and Responsiveness" in the `/docs/ux-evaluation/usability/reservation-flow/mobile-adapted-problem-finding-template.md`.
    *   **Summary of Findings Populated:** The "Summary of Findings" section in the problem finding template was populated. Issues were categorized by priority based on their Severity Rating (SR) and Ease to Fix Rating (ER).

3.  **Cross-Verification:**
    *   A thorough cross-check was performed between the `/docs/ux-evaluation/usability/reservation-flow/mobile-adapted-evaluation-template.md` (source of issues) and the `/docs/ux-evaluation/usability/reservation-flow/mobile-adapted-problem-finding-template.md` (list of problems). This confirmed that all identified usability issues (items marked "No" or with SR > 0 in the evaluation) were accurately transferred and documented in the problem finding template.

All documentation related to the heuristic evaluation of the mobile reservation flow is now considered complete and up-to-date.
