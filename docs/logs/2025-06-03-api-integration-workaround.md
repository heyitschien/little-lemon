### Objective:
Continue integration of the external booking API, resolve loading issues, and ensure dynamic fetching and submission of reservation data.

### Summary of Activities:

1.  **Problem Identification:**
    *   Encountered an "Error: Booking API not loaded" when attempting to use `fetchAPI` and `submitAPI` from the Coursera-provided external script (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/courseraap/capstone/main/api.js`).
    *   Diagnosed the issue: The functions in the external `api.js` are defined using `const` at the top level. In a standard browser environment, this scopes them to the script itself, and they are not automatically attached to the `window` object or made globally available in a way that React modules can access them directly.

2.  **Implemented Workaround for Local Development:**
    *   **Created `public/mockApi.js`:**
        *   Copied the `seededRandom`, `fetchAPI`, and `submitAPI` function logic from the Coursera script.
        *   Crucially, modified `fetchAPI` and `submitAPI` to be explicitly assigned to the global `window` object (e.g., `window.fetchAPI = function(...) {}`).
        *   This makes the functions accessible to the React application code via `window.fetchAPI` and `window.submitAPI`.
    *   **Updated `index.html`:**
        *   Commented out the original `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/courseraap/capstone/main/api.js"></script>`.
        *   Added `<script src="/mockApi.js"></script>` to load the local mock API before the main application script.

3.  **Code Adjustments in `src/hooks/useReservation.js`:**
    *   Ensured that the hook attempts to call `window.fetchAPI` and `window.submitAPI`.
    *   Previously, an attempt was made to check for `fetchAPI` and `submitAPI` directly as globals (e.g., `window.fetchAPI || fetchAPI`). While the `/* global fetchAPI, submitAPI */` ESLint directive was added to suppress 'not defined' errors for this pattern, the most direct and reliable solution with our `mockApi.js` is to use the `window.` prefix, as the mock API explicitly attaches them there.

4.  **Verification:**
    *   Started the Vite development server.
    *   Confirmed in the browser that the "mockApi.js loaded and functions attached to window." message appeared in the console.
    *   Verified that the "Error: Booking API not loaded" message on the booking page was resolved.
    *   Successfully tested dynamic fetching of available times based on date selection and simulated reservation submission using the `mockApi.js`.

### Outcome:
The booking page is now successfully using the local `mockApi.js` to simulate the intended API behavior, allowing for continued development and testing of the reservation flow. The core issue with the external API script's scoping in a local development environment has been effectively bypassed.

### Next Steps (from previous plan):
*   Update/create unit and integration tests for the API integration changes.
*   Further refinement of error handling and edge cases if identified during testing.
*   Update relevant documentation (e.g., `browser-api-transition-strategy.md`) to reflect the use of the mock API for local development.
