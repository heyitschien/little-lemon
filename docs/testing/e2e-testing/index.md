# End-to-End Testing Documentation

## Overview

This section contains documentation related to end-to-end (E2E) testing the Little Lemon application using Playwright.

## Contents

- [Playwright Main Principles & User Guide](./playwright-main-principles.md) - Core concepts and guidelines for using Playwright.
- [Playwright Specific Configuration](./playwright-little-lemon-config.md) - Details on the `playwright.config.ts` for this project.
- [Test Scenarios](./test-scenarios.md) - Defined E2E test scenarios and user flows to be automated.

## Mobile E2E Testing

Since the Little Lemon application is primarily focused on mobile, our E2E testing approach includes:
- Mobile device emulation for accurate testing
- Testing on various mobile viewport sizes
- Mobile-specific user flows and interactions
- Performance testing on mobile devices
