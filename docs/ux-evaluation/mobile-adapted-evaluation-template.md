## 1. Visibility of System Status
> The mobile app informs the user about what is going on through constructive, appropriate and timely feedback.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |

| Is the reservation status clearly displayed throughout the process? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
> Language usage, such as terms and phrases, symbols, and concepts, is similar to that used by the users in their day-to-day environment. Information is arranged in a natural and logical order.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |

| Do menu choices fit logically into categories that make sense to users? |     |    |    |    |

| Are date and time selectors intuitive and similar to native OS controls? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 3. User Control and Freedom

| Is there a clear back button or gesture to return to previous screens? |     |    |    |    |

| Can users easily edit their inputs before final submission? |     |    |    |    |
| Is there a home button or gesture accessible from all screens? |     |    |    |    |
| Can users modify or cancel their reservations after submission? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 4. Consistency and Adherence to Standards

## 5. Error Prevention
> The system is designed so that the users cannot easily make serious usability errors. When a user makes an error, the application gives an appropriate error message.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |
| Does the app validate input in real-time (e.g., date/time availability)? |     |    |    |    |
| Are form fields clearly labeled with required information? |     |    |    |    |
| Does the app prevent selection of invalid options (e.g., past dates)? |     |    |    |    |
| Are confirmation screens shown before final submission? |     |    |    |    |
| Are potentially destructive actions placed away from frequently used actions? |     |    |    |    |
| Does the app prevent double-submission of the same reservation? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
> Options for selection, and actions to be taken, are visible. The user does not need to recall information from one part of a dialogue to another. Instructions on how to use the system are visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |

| Does the app show previously entered information when relevant? |     |    |    |    |

| Are hints or examples provided for complex input fields? |     |    |    |    |
| Are important instructions visible when needed rather than hidden in help sections? |     |    |    |    |
| Does the app remember and suggest previous user choices? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
> The app caters to different levels of users, from novice to expert. Shortcuts or accelerators, unseen by novice users, are provided to speed up interaction and task completion by frequent users.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |
| Does the app offer shortcuts for common actions (e.g., quick reservation)? |     |    |    |    |
| Can users save preferences or favorite settings? |     |    |    |    |
| Are there multiple ways to accomplish the same task? |     |    |    |    |
| Does the app support both gesture controls and button taps? |     |    |    |    |
| Can users access their reservation history easily? |     |    |    |    |
| Are there time-saving features for frequent users? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
> Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |
| Is the interface clean and free of clutter? |     |    |    |    |
| Is content prioritized with the most important information prominent? |     |    |    |    |
| Are screens focused on one primary task or goal? |     |    |    |    |
| Is white space used effectively to create visual hierarchy? |     |    |    |    |
| Are colors used sparingly and purposefully? |     |    |    |    |
| Is text concise and scannable? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 9. Recognition, Diagnosis, and Recovery from Errors
> Error messages are expressed in plain language. Error messages indicate precisely what the problem is and give quick, simple, constructive, specific instructions for recovery.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |
| Are error messages displayed in plain, non-technical language? |     |    |    |    |
| Do error messages clearly explain what went wrong? |     |    |    |    |
| Do error messages suggest a solution or next step? |     |    |    |    |
| Are errors shown in context near the problem area? |     |    |    |    |
| Are validation errors shown in real-time when possible? |     |    |    |    |
| Can users easily recover from errors and continue their task? |     |    |    |    |

---

## 10. Help and Documentation
> The app has a help facility and other documentation to support the user's needs. The information in these documents is easy to search, focused on the user's task and lists concrete steps to be carried out to accomplish a task.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |
| Is help content available within the app? |     |    |    |    |
| Is help contextual to the user's current task? |     |    |    |    |
| Are FAQs provided for common questions about reservations? |     |    |    |    |
| Can users easily contact support if needed? |     |    |    |    |
| Are tutorials or tooltips available for first-time users? |     |    |    |    |
| Is the help content searchable and concise? |     |    |    |    |
