## 1. Visibility of System Status
> The mobile app informs the user about what is going on through constructive, appropriate and timely feedback.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
> Language usage, such as terms and phrases, symbols and concepts, is similar to that used in their day-to-day environment by the users. Information is arranged in a natural and logical order.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 3. User Control and Freedom
> Users control the system. Users can exit the system at any time even when they have not made mistakes. There are facilities for Undo and Redo.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 4. Consistency and Adherence to Standards
> Concepts, words, symbols, situations, or actions refer to the same thing. The app follows platform conventions.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 5. Error Prevention
> The system is designed so that the users cannot easily make serious usability errors. When a user makes an error, the application gives an appropriate error message.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
> Options for selection and actions to be taken, are visible. The user does not need to recall information from one part of a dialogue to another. Instructions on how to use the system are visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
> The app caters to different levels of users, from novice to expert. Shortcuts or accelerators, unseen by novice users, are provided to speed up interaction and task completion by frequent users.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalism in Design
> Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 9. Recognition, Diagnosis, and Recovery from Errors
> Error messages are expressed in plain language. Error messages indicate precisely what the problem is and give quick, simple, constructive, specific instructions for recovery.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |

---

## 10. Help and Documentation
> The site has a help facility and other documentation to support the user's needs. The information in these documents is easy to search, focused on the user's task and lists concrete steps to be carried out to accomplish a task.

| Problem Found | Screen/Location | ER | Recommendation |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :- | :------------ |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
|               |                 |    |               |
