# Little Lemon Mobile App Usability Testing Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for evaluating the usability of the Little Lemon mobile application's reserve-a-table functionality. The plan follows industry standard practices for usability evaluation and combines both expert-based evaluation methods (heuristic evaluation) and user-based testing methods (task-based usability testing).

## 2. Evaluation Goals

1. Identify usability issues in the current mobile reservation flow
2. Assess the severity of identified issues
3. Determine the effort required to fix each issue
4. Prioritize improvements based on impact and implementation effort
5. Create an actionable plan for enhancing the user experience

## 3. Evaluation Timeline

| Phase | Activities | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1. Preparation | Review existing app, create test materials | 1 week | Test plan, scenarios, evaluation templates |
| 2. Expert Evaluation | Conduct heuristic evaluation | 1 week | Completed heuristic evaluation report |
| 3. User Testing | Recruit participants, conduct tests | 2 weeks | Test recordings, observation notes |
| 4. Analysis | Analyze findings, prioritize issues | 1 week | Prioritized issue list |
| 5. Recommendations | Develop solutions for identified issues | 1 week | UX improvement recommendations |

## 4. Evaluation Methods

### 4.1 Heuristic Evaluation

#### Process
1. **Preparation**: Adapt evaluation templates for mobile context
2. **Evaluation**: 3-5 UX experts independently evaluate the app using Nielsen's 10 heuristics
3. **Consolidation**: Combine findings and eliminate duplicates
