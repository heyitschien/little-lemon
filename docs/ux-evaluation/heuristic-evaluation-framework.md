# Little Lemon Mobile App Heuristic Evaluation Framework

## Overview
This document provides a structured framework for conducting a heuristic evaluation of the Little Lemon mobile application, with special focus on the table reservation functionality.

## Evaluation Methodology
Each heuristic will be evaluated on a severity scale:
- **0** - Not a usability problem
- **1** - Cosmetic problem only
- **2** - Minor usability problem
- **3** - Major usability problem
- **4** - Usability catastrophe

## 1. Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

### 1.1 Visibility of System Status
- Does the app keep users informed about what is happening?
- Are loading states clearly indicated?
- Is feedback provided within reasonable time?
- **Mobile-specific**: Are touch interactions acknowledged visually?

### 1.2 Match Between System and the Real World
- Does the app use language familiar to the user?
- Do icons represent real-world concepts?
- Is information presented in a natural and logical order?
- **Mobile-specific**: Are mobile conventions followed?

### 1.3 User Control and Freedom
- Are there clear "emergency exits" for unintended actions?
- Is there support for undo and redo?
- Can users navigate back easily?
- **Mobile-specific**: Are gesture controls intuitive and reversible?

### 1.4 Consistency and Standards
- Does the app follow platform conventions?
- Are internal elements consistent throughout the app?
- **Mobile-specific**: Does the app follow iOS/Android design guidelines?

### 1.5 Error Prevention
- Are potential errors identified before they occur?
- Are confirmation options available for consequential actions?
- **Mobile-specific**: Are touch targets sized appropriately to prevent mis-taps?

### 1.6 Recognition Rather Than Recall
- Are options, actions, and objects visible?
- Is information needed for decisions visible or easily retrievable?
- **Mobile-specific**: Is navigation discoverable without requiring memorization?

### 1.7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- Are there shortcuts for experienced users?
- Can users customize frequent actions?
- **Mobile-specific**: Are there gesture shortcuts for common actions?

### 1.8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- Is the design free of irrelevant information?
- Is visual hierarchy appropriate?
- **Mobile-specific**: Is the design optimized for smaller screens?

### 1.9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
- Are error messages expressed in plain language?
- Do they suggest solutions?
- **Mobile-specific**: Are errors displayed in a way that doesn't obscure content?

### 1.10 Help and Documentation
- Is help documentation easy to search?
- Is it focused on user tasks?
- **Mobile-specific**: Is help accessible within the mobile context?

## 2. Ben Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules

### 2.1 Strive for Consistency
- Consistent sequences of actions
- Identical terminology in prompts, menus, and help screens
- Consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts

### 2.2 Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts
- Abbreviations, special keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities

### 2.3 Offer Informative Feedback
- For every user action, system feedback

### 2.4 Design Dialogs to Yield Closure
- Sequences of actions organized with a beginning, middle, and end

### 2.5 Offer Error Prevention and Simple Error Handling
- Design to prevent serious errors
- If an error occurs, detect it and offer simple mechanisms for handling

### 2.6 Permit Easy Reversal of Actions
- Actions should be reversible

### 2.7 Support Internal Locus of Control
- Experienced operators desire the sense they are in charge of the system

### 2.8 Reduce Short-Term Memory Load
- Displays should be simple, multiple page displays consolidated, window-motion frequency reduced

## 3. Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of Good Design

### 3.1 Good Design Is Innovative
- Does the app provide innovative solutions to problems?

### 3.2 Good Design Makes a Product Useful
- Does the app enhance the core functionality of table reservation?

### 3.3 Good Design Is Aesthetic
- Is the app visually appealing while remaining functional?

### 3.4 Good Design Makes a Product Understandable
- Is the app self-explanatory?

### 3.5 Good Design Is Unobtrusive
- Does the design serve the purpose without being distracting?

### 3.6 Good Design Is Honest
- Does the app make promises it can't keep?

### 3.7 Good Design Is Long-lasting
- Will the design remain relevant over time?

### 3.8 Good Design Is Thorough Down to the Last Detail
- Is attention paid to every detail?

### 3.9 Good Design Is Environmentally Friendly
- Does the app minimize resource usage?

### 3.10 Good Design Is as Little Design as Possible
- Is the app focused on the essentials?

## 4. Mobile-Specific Evaluation Criteria

### 4.1 Touch Target Size
- Minimum size of 44x44px for all interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between touch targets

### 4.2 Thumb Zone Optimization
- Important actions placed within easy thumb reach
- Critical functions accessible one-handed

### 4.3 Gesture Support
- Intuitive gesture implementation
- Consistency with platform standards

### 4.4 Responsive Layout
- Proper adaptation to different screen sizes
- Orientation changes handled gracefully

### 4.5 Performance
- App responsiveness on target devices
- Animation smoothness

### 4.6 Offline Capability
- Core functionality available offline
- Proper handling of connectivity issues
