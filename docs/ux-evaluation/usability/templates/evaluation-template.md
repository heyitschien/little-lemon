## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
> Options for selection, and actions to be taken, are visible. The user does not need to recall information from one part of a dialogue to another. Instructions on how to use the system are visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |

| Does the system scale for new users as well as advanced users? |     |    |    |    |

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalism in Design
> Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |

| Does each icon stand out from its background?                |     |    |    |    |
| Are meaningful groups of items separated by white space?     |     |    |    |    |

---

## 9. Recognition, Diagnosis, and Recovery from Errors
> Error messages are expressed in plain language. Error messages indicate precisely what the problem is and give quick, simple, constructive, specific instructions for recovery.

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-- | :- | :- | :- |
| Is there a clear indication that something has gone wrong?   |     |    |    |    |
| Is there an error message stating exactly what went wrong?   |     |    |    |    |
| Is there a solution offered, like a shortcut that can solve the error immediately? |     |    |    |    |

| Checklist                                                    | Yes | No | NA | SR |
