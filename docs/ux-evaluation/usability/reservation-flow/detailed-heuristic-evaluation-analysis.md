## Heuristic 1: Visibility of System Status
> The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there a clear title or header for each screen/step?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationPage.jsx` uses `<h1>` for the main page title and renders step-specific titles like "Choose Date, Time & Party Size", "Your Information", "Review & Confirm", and "Reservation Confirmed!" based on `currentStep`. Components like `DateTimeSelector` and `ReservationConfirmation` also have their own `pageTitle` class for their main heading.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Are selected items or active navigation elements clearly highlighted?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationPage.jsx` includes a `ProgressIndicator` component showing `Step ${currentStep} of ${TOTAL_STEPS -1}`. While not a visual "highlight" of navigation items in a list, it clearly indicates the current stage. Form inputs typically show focus styling from the browser.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., button presses, loading states)?"
    *   **Analysis:** Buttons have hover/active states (standard browser behavior, can be enhanced with CSS). `useReservation.js` manages `isLoadingTimes` for `DateTimeSelector.jsx` (showing "Loading times...") and `isSubmitting` for `ReservationConfirmation.jsx` (disabling button and changing text to "Submitting...").
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Are error messages or success notifications clearly displayed?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationForm.jsx` and `DateTimeSelector.jsx` display validation errors using `styles.errorMessage` near the respective fields. `ReservationPage.jsx` shows a success message "Reservation Confirmed!" and details in Step 4.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app provide feedback on system delays (e.g., loading indicators)?"
    *   **Analysis:** Yes, `isLoadingTimes` in `DateTimeSelector.jsx` and `isSubmitting` in `ReservationConfirmation.jsx` provide explicit feedback during delays.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 2: Match Between System and the Real World
> The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app use familiar language, icons, and conventions?"
    *   **Analysis:** Language used ("Date", "Time", "Party Size", "Full Name", "Email", "Confirm Reservation") is standard. The calendar icon for date input is familiar. The multi-step form is a common web convention.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Is information presented in a logical and natural order?"
    *   **Analysis:** The reservation flow (Date/Time/Party -> Your Information -> Review & Confirm) follows a logical sequence that mirrors real-world reservation processes.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Do icons and images clearly represent their meaning?"
    *   **Analysis:** The primary icon is the calendar icon, which is universally understood. Numerical step indicators are also clear.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app avoid technical jargon?"
    *   **Analysis:** The language used throughout the components (`ReservationPage.jsx`, `DateTimeSelector.jsx`, `ReservationForm.jsx`, `ReservationConfirmation.jsx`) is user-friendly and avoids technical terms.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Are menu choices and categories relevant to the user's task?"
    *   **Analysis:** Input fields and options (e.g., "Occasion" in `ReservationForm.jsx`) are directly relevant to making a restaurant reservation.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 3: User Control and Freedom
> Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there a clear back button or gesture to return to previous screens?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationPage.jsx` implements `handlePreviousStep`. A "Back" button is present in Step 2 (Your Information) that calls `handlePreviousStep`. The "Modify" button in Step 3 (Review & Confirm) also calls `handlePreviousStep`, allowing users to go back and edit details.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Can users cancel actions in progress (like reservation submission)?"
    *   **Analysis:** Before the final "Confirm Reservation" click (Step 3), users can use the "Modify" button to go back, effectively canceling the immediate intent to submit and allowing changes or abandonment of the flow by navigating elsewhere. Once "Confirm Reservation" is clicked and `isSubmitting` is true, there isn't an explicit UI element to cancel that specific in-flight asynchronous submission, though this phase is typically brief.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (effectively, before final confirmation)
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Are confirmation dialogs used before destructive actions (like canceling a reservation)?"
    *   **Analysis:** The primary action in this flow is *creating* a reservation. Step 3 ("Review & Confirm") acts as the confirmation stage *before* this creation occurs. Canceling an *already submitted* reservation is a separate process.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (for the booking action)
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Can users easily edit their inputs before final submission?"
    *   **Analysis:** Yes, the "Modify" button on the `ReservationConfirmation.jsx` screen (Step 3) allows users to return to previous steps to make changes.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there a home button or gesture accessible from all screens?"
    *   **Analysis:** The `ReservationPage.jsx` component itself, during steps 1-3 of the focused reservation task, does not render its own "Home" button. However, a standard mobile application structure (with a global `Header` containing `Nav`) would provide persistent navigation. The success screen (Step 4) explicitly provides a "Return to Home" button.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (assuming standard app global navigation; explicitly present on the success screen)
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Can users modify or cancel their reservations after submission?"
    *   **Analysis:** The success message text in `ReservationPage.jsx` (case 4) and `ReservationConfirmation.jsx` states: "To cancel or modify your reservation, please call us at (123) 456-7890 at least 2 hours before your reservation time." This indicates that online modification or cancellation *after* a reservation is successfully submitted is **not** supported directly within the app.
    *   **Assessment:** No
    *   **SR:** 3

---

## Heuristic 4: Consistency and Adherence to Standards
> Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app follow platform-specific design guidelines (iOS/Android)?"
    *   **Analysis:** The use of `<input type="date">` in `DateTimeSelector.jsx` aims to leverage native platform date pickers. Styling is generally custom (via CSS Modules), not strictly adhering to native iOS or Android visual styles, but rather creating a branded experience. This is common for cross-platform web apps.
    *   **Assessment:** No (for strict visual adherence, but leverages native controls where beneficial)
    *   **SR:** 1

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Are interactive elements (buttons, links) consistently styled?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationPage.jsx` uses a common `Button` component for its primary navigation buttons. Form elements within `ReservationForm.jsx` and `DateTimeSelector.jsx` are styled consistently using CSS modules.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Is the navigation pattern consistent throughout the app?"
    *   **Analysis:** Within the reservation flow, the navigation is consistently a multi-step process with "Next" and "Back" (or "Modify" acting as back) buttons.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (within the reservation feature)
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Are form fields and inputs consistent in appearance and behavior?"
    *   **Analysis:** `input`, `select`, and `textarea` elements are styled consistently via CSS modules. They use standard HTML properties and event handlers. Error display also appears consistent.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Are icons and their meanings consistent throughout the app?"
    *   **Analysis:** The calendar icon for the date picker is standard. Numerical step indicators are clear. The reservation flow itself is not heavily icon-driven beyond these.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (within the reservation feature; limited icon usage)
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Is terminology consistent across all screens?"
    *   **Analysis:** Terms like "Reservation," "Date," "Time," "Party Size," "Confirm," "Next," "Back," "Modify" are used consistently across the different steps and components of the reservation flow.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 5: Error Prevention
> Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app validate input in real-time (e.g., date/time availability)?"
    *   **Analysis:** `DateTimeSelector.jsx` fetches `availableTimes` when the date changes and resets time if invalid. `ReservationForm.jsx` and `DateTimeSelector.jsx` use `onBlur` and `onTouchEnd` events to call `validateField` for individual fields.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Are form fields clearly labeled with required information?"
    *   **Analysis:** Required fields in `DateTimeSelector.jsx` and `ReservationForm.jsx` are marked with asterisks (via `styles.requiredIndicator`) and/or have the `required` HTML attribute. Optional fields are labeled as such.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app prevent selection of invalid options (e.g., past dates)?"
    *   **Analysis:** `DateTimeSelector.jsx` date input uses `min` and `max` attributes. The `availableTimes` logic only shows valid, bookable times.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Are confirmation screens shown before final submission?"
    *   **Analysis:** Yes, `ReservationPage.jsx` Step 3 renders `ReservationConfirmation.jsx`, displaying all details for review.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Are potentially destructive actions placed away from frequently used actions?"
    *   **Analysis:** Confirming the reservation is the final step. The "Modify" button on the confirmation screen is clearly distinct from "Confirm Reservation".
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app prevent double-submission of the same reservation?"
    *   **Analysis:** In `ReservationConfirmation.jsx`, the "Confirm Reservation" button is `disabled={isSubmitting}`. This prevents rapid re-clicks during a single submission attempt.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (for preventing rapid re-clicks)
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 6: Recognition Rather Than Recall
> Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Are options and actions clearly visible and accessible?"
    *   **Analysis:** Core actions (selecting date/time/party size, filling form fields, navigating) are presented with clear, visible UI elements. Step titles in `ReservationPage.jsx` keep the user aware of their current location.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app provide context-sensitive help or information?"
    *   **Analysis:** `DateTimeSelector.jsx` provides helper text and error messages. `ReservationForm.jsx` uses placeholder text and displays error messages. Optional fields are marked.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Are recently used or selected items easily accessible (or remembered by the system)?"
    *   **Analysis:** The `reservationData` state managed by `useReservation.js` stores all user inputs for the current session. This data populates the confirmation screen and is retained if the user navigates back.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (within current session)
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Is information presented in a logical and easy-to-understand manner?"
    *   **Analysis:** The reservation flow is logical. Labels are clear. The confirmation screen aggregates details structurally.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app use familiar icons and symbols?"
    *   **Analysis:** Calendar icon, asterisk for required fields, and progress indicators are familiar.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Are instructions clear and concise?"
    *   **Analysis:** Screen titles, button labels, and field labels are direct and descriptive.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

7.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app remember and suggest previous user choices (e.g., past reservation details for quick rebooking)?"
    *   **Analysis:** The system remembers user input *within the current booking session*. There is no indication that it remembers details from *previously completed and separate* reservation sessions to suggest them for a new booking.
    *   **Assessment:** No (for suggesting details from past, separate reservations)
    *   **SR:** 2

---

## Heuristic 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
> Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app offer shortcuts for frequent users (e.g., quick booking from history)?"
    *   **Analysis:** The current flow does not offer a "quick booking" or "rebook" feature based on past reservation history.
    *   **Assessment:** No
    *   **SR:** 2

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Can users customize or personalize the interface (e.g., save favorite settings)?"
    *   **Analysis:** No evidence of features allowing users to save default party sizes, preferred times, or other personalized settings for reservations.
    *   **Assessment:** No
    *   **SR:** 1

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app allow for different interaction methods (e.g., keyboard and touch input)?"
    *   **Analysis:** Being a web-based application using standard HTML form elements, it inherently supports both touch and keyboard input.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Are there clear ways to navigate to frequently accessed sections?"
    *   **Analysis:** Within the reservation flow, navigation is linear. Accessing the reservation feature from other parts of the app is assumed to be clear.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (assuming a clear entry point to the reservation flow)
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app support common mobile gestures (swipe, pinch, etc.) where appropriate?"
    *   **Analysis:** Standard swipe gestures for scrolling would work. No indication of custom gesture support for navigation between steps.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (for standard browser-handled gestures)
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Can users complete tasks efficiently with minimal steps?"
    *   **Analysis:** The 3-step process (Date/Time/Party -> Your Info -> Confirm) is reasonably efficient.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
> Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Is the visual design clean and uncluttered?"
    *   **Analysis:** Components focus on the task. The multi-step approach breaks down information, preventing clutter.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app avoid irrelevant or distracting elements?"
    *   **Analysis:** Reservation flow components are task-oriented. No evidence of unnecessary advertisements or unrelated information.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Is the content concise and to the point?"
    *   **Analysis:** Labels for form fields, button text, error messages, and helper texts are generally brief and informative.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there a clear visual hierarchy of information?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationPage.jsx` uses heading levels. Labels are visually distinct from inputs. Buttons are identifiable. Progress indicator provides place.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Is the use of color and typography appropriate and not overwhelming?"
    *   **Analysis:** Assumed consistency with overall app design principles (clarity, premium feel). Visual cues for errors suggest considered use.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Are icons simple, clear, and used sparingly?"
    *   **Analysis:** Main icon is the standard calendar icon. Flow is not heavily reliant on icons, aligning with minimalism.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
> Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Are error messages clear, concise, and in plain language?"
    *   **Analysis:** Validation errors (e.g., "Full name is required") and submission errors (e.g., "Submission failed. Please try again.") are generally clear.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Do error messages precisely indicate the problem?"
    *   **Analysis:** Field-specific validation errors directly point to the problematic input field and are typically displayed nearby.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Do error messages suggest a solution or how to fix the error?"
    *   **Analysis:** The nature of the error usually implies the solution (e.g., "Invalid email format" suggests correcting the email).
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Are errors visually distinct and noticeable?"
    *   **Analysis:** Uses `styles.inputError` (e.g., red border) and `styles.errorMessage` (e.g., red text). ARIA attributes like `aria-invalid` are used.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app prevent users from proceeding if there are critical errors?"
    *   **Analysis:** The "Next" and "Confirm Reservation" buttons trigger validation, and the flow does not proceed if `validateForm` returns false.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Is it easy for users to correct errors once identified?"
    *   **Analysis:** Errors are displayed near relevant fields, allowing direct editing. Other valid data is retained.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

---

## Heuristic 10: Help and Documentation
> Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Is help documentation easy to find if needed?"
    *   **Analysis:** No direct links to a help section or FAQ within the reservation flow components. Contextual help is provided (error messages, helper text).
    *   **Assessment:** No (within the flow itself for broader documentation)
    *   **SR:** 1

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Is the help documentation focused on the user's task?"
    *   **Analysis:** Contextual help (error messages, placeholder text, optional field labels) is directly focused on the task of booking.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (for the contextual help provided)
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the help documentation list concrete steps to be carried out?"
    *   **Analysis:** The UI flow itself (labels, step indicators, button text) guides users. Error messages imply corrective steps. The post-submission message for cancellation/modification gives a concrete step.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (UI and contextual messages guide through steps)
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Is the help documentation concise and not too large?"
    *   **Analysis:** All contextual help (labels, error messages, placeholders) is concise.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

5.  **Checklist Item:** "Are tooltips or contextual help provided for complex features or inputs?"
    *   **Analysis:** Placeholder text and helper/error messages serve this purpose. No explicit "tooltip" UI elements are used for the straightforward inputs.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (through existing contextual messages)
    *   **SR:** 0

6.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there a FAQ section or knowledge base available?"
    *   **Analysis:** Not directly visible or linked from within the reservation flow components. The message about how to cancel/modify is a proactive FAQ answer.
    *   **Assessment:** No (not directly linked or integrated into this specific flow)
    *   **SR:** 1

---

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

### Touch Interaction

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Are touch targets at least 44x44px in size?"
    *   **Analysis:** Standard HTML elements (buttons, inputs), when rendered by modern browsers with typical styling, generally aim for accessible touch target sizes. This is assumed based on good practice without inspecting final rendered CSS.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (assuming standard rendering and styling)
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Is there sufficient spacing between touch targets?"
    *   **Analysis:** Form elements are typically block-level or have clear visual separation. Buttons for navigation are distinct.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (assuming standard layout practices)
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Are interactive elements easily reachable in one-handed use?"
    *   **Analysis:** Primary action buttons (Next, Confirm) are generally placed at the bottom of the content for each step, a common pattern for one-handed mobile use.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Do gestures follow platform conventions?"
    *   **Analysis:** The app primarily uses tap gestures for buttons/inputs and standard scroll gestures. The native date picker also uses standard gestures.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

### Performance and Responsiveness

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app respond quickly to user interactions (<100ms)?"
    *   **Analysis:** Client-side logic (validation, state updates) should be fast. API calls (`fetchAvailableTimes`, `submitReservation`) have loading states (`isLoadingTimes`, `isSubmitting`). Mock APIs are instantaneous; real-world performance depends on network/server.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (for client-side; server-dependent actions have feedback)
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Are animations smooth and purposeful?"
    *   **Analysis:** No significant custom animations are noted within the reservation flow components. Standard UI updates are handled by React.
    *   **Assessment:** NA (No prominent custom animations observed)
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app function well under poor network conditions?"
    *   **Analysis:** The app includes loading states for network-dependent operations. `useReservation.js` has `try...catch` blocks for API calls, allowing basic error messages. More sophisticated offline handling or retry mechanisms are not evident.
    *   **Assessment:** No (for robust offline functionality or advanced network resilience)
    *   **SR:** 1

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Is scrolling smooth without jank or lag?"
    *   **Analysis:** The forms are relatively simple. Standard browser scrolling should be smooth. No complex on-scroll calculations are apparent.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (assuming standard browser performance)
    *   **SR:** 0

### Form Input

1.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app use appropriate keyboard types for different inputs?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationForm.jsx` uses `type="email"` and `type="tel"`. `DateTimeSelector.jsx` uses `type="number"` for party size. These trigger appropriate mobile keyboards.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

2.  **Checklist Item:** "Are form fields visible when the keyboard is open?"
    *   **Analysis:** This is largely handled by the mobile browser's default behavior, which typically reflows or scrolls the focused input into view. Standard block layout for forms supports this.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes (assuming standard browser behavior)
    *   **SR:** 0

3.  **Checklist Item:** "Does the app support autofill where appropriate?"
    *   **Analysis:** `ReservationForm.jsx` uses `autoComplete` attributes for name, email, and phone number, enabling browser autofill.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0

4.  **Checklist Item:** "Can users easily navigate between form fields?"
    *   **Analysis:** Standard mobile browser behavior allows tapping on the next field. The "Go" or "Next" key on virtual keyboards often moves focus logically.
    *   **Assessment:** Yes
    *   **SR:** 0
