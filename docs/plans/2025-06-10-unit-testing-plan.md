# Unit Testing Plan for Little Lemon Mobile App

## Overview
This document outlines our plan for implementing comprehensive unit tests for the Little Lemon mobile app, with a focus on the recently completed cart redesign and mobile UI improvements.

## Testing Priorities

### 1. Cart Functionality
- **Cart Context Tests**
  - Test adding items to cart
  - Test removing items from cart
  - Test updating item quantities
  - Test cart total calculation
  - Test cart persistence in localStorage

- **CartPage Component Tests**
  - Test rendering with empty cart
  - Test rendering with items in cart
  - Test mobile swipe-to-remove functionality
  - Test quantity controls
  - Test checkout flow

- **CartMenuSection Component Tests**
  - Test category filtering
  - Test horizontal scrolling behavior
  - Test item rendering

### 2. Mobile UI Components
- **Button Component Tests**
  - Test all button variants
  - Test accessibility attributes
  - Test responsive behavior

- **Responsive Layout Tests**
  - Test breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Test touch interactions
  - Test swipe gestures

### 3. User Flows
- **Add to Cart Flow**
  - Test adding items from menu to cart
  - Test adding recommended items from cart page

- **Checkout Flow**
  - Test cart validation
  - Test order summary display

## Testing Tools
- Jest for unit and component testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Jest-axe for accessibility testing
- Mock Service Worker for API mocking

## Test File Structure
```
src/
  __tests__/
    components/
      features/
        Cart/
          CartMenuItemCard.test.jsx
          CartMenuSection.test.jsx
      common/
        Button/
          Button.test.jsx
    context/
      CartContext.test.jsx
    pages/
      CartPage/
        CartPage.test.jsx
```

## Implementation Plan for Tomorrow

### Morning Session
1. Set up Jest configuration and testing utilities
2. Implement tests for CartContext
3. Implement tests for Button component

### Afternoon Session
1. Implement tests for CartPage component
2. Implement tests for CartMenuSection and CartMenuItemCard components
3. Implement integration tests for cart user flows

### Evening Session
1. Run all tests and fix any failures
2. Measure test coverage and identify gaps
3. Document testing approach and results

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests must pass
- Test coverage should be at least 80% for new components
- All critical user flows must have integration tests
- Accessibility tests must pass for all components

## Future Testing Considerations
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Performance testing for mobile devices
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
