# Little Lemon Project - House Cleaning Phase 2 Log

## 1. Project Information

-   **Project Name**: Little Lemon Web Application
-   **Developer**: Chien
-   **Project Start Date**: 2025-05-27 (Based on initial Git commit)
-   **Log Creation Date**: 2025-05-30
-   **Current Phase**: House Cleaning - Phase 2 (Component Reorganization)
-   **Branch**: `feature/house-cleaning-phase2`

## 2. Activity Summary

Today's house cleaning activities focused on reorganizing the component structure to improve maintainability and clarity. The components were organized into three main categories:

1. **Layout Components**: Components that define the structure of the application
2. **Feature Components**: Components specific to certain features
3. **Common Components**: Reusable components

## 3. Detailed Activity Log

### Date: 2025-05-30

#### Component Reorganization

1. **Created Directory Structure**:
   - `src/components/layout/` for layout components
   - `src/components/features/` for feature-specific components
   - `src/components/common/` for common/reusable components

2. **Moved Layout Components**:
   - **Header**: Moved to `src/components/layout/Header/`
   - **Footer**: Moved to `src/components/layout/Footer/`
   - **Hero**: Moved to `src/components/layout/Hero/`
   - **Nav**: Moved to `src/components/layout/Nav/`
   - **MainComponent**: Moved to `src/components/layout/MainComponent/`

3. **Moved Feature Components**:
   - **Menu Components**:
     - Renamed `OrderDeliveryCard` to `MenuItemCard` and moved to `src/components/features/Menu/MenuItemCard/`
     - Renamed `OrderForDelivery` to `MenuSection` and moved to `src/components/features/Menu/MenuSection/`
   - **About**: Moved to `src/components/features/About/`
   - **Testimonials**: Moved to `src/components/features/Testimonials/`
   - **Reservation Components**: Moved to `src/components/features/Reservation/`
   - **ChatAssistant**: Moved to `src/components/features/ChatAssistant/`

4. **Moved Common Components**:
   - **Button**: Moved to `src/components/common/Button/`

5. **Removed Duplicate Components**:
   - Removed original components after they were successfully moved to their new locations

#### Import Path Updates

1. **Updated Import Paths**:
   - Updated all import paths to reflect the new component locations
   - Fixed relative paths for assets, services, and utilities

2. **Fixed Import Errors**:
   - Updated Logo import path in Footer component
   - Fixed chat bubble icon path in ChatAssistant
   - Corrected service import paths in Reservation components

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Continue thorough testing of all application features to ensure the restructuring hasn't broken any functionality.
2. **Documentation**: Update any project documentation to reflect the new component organization.
3. **Merge to Staging**: Once testing is complete, merge the changes to the staging branch.

## 6. Notes

- The restructuring has significantly improved the organization and maintainability of the codebase.
- The new structure makes it easier for the team to understand the component hierarchy and continue development.
- All functionality has been preserved during the restructuring process.
