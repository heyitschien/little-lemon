## Overview

This document tracks the next steps for the Little Lemon project after completing the documentation restructuring and house cleaning phases. It serves as a living document that team members can reference and update as the project progresses.

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Testing

1. **Set up Testing Framework**
   - Implement Jest and React Testing Library
   - Configure test scripts in package.json
   - Set up test directory structure

2. **Component Testing Priorities**
   - Test common components first (Button, etc.)
   - Test critical user flows (reservation process)
   - Implement tests for mobile-specific functionality

3. **Hook Testing**
   - Test custom hooks
   - Ensure proper state management
   - Verify mobile responsiveness hooks

### End-to-End Testing

1. **Playwright Configuration**
   - Review and update existing Playwright configuration
   - Set up test scenarios based on user journeys
   - Implement mobile viewport testing

2. **Critical Flows to Test**
   - Reservation process from start to finish
   - Menu browsing and filtering
   - Mobile navigation and responsiveness

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Update GitHub Actions workflow to run tests
   - Implement test reporting
   - Configure auto-merge based on test results

## Component Refactoring

1. **Common Components Review**
   - Review components identified in common-components-analysis.md
   - Prioritize components for refactoring
   - Create migration plan

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Review components for mobile performance
   - Optimize image loading and rendering
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Implement consistent prop validation
   - Review and refactor complex components
   - Reduce component coupling

## Performance Optimization

1. **Bundle Size Analysis**
   - Analyze current bundle size
   - Identify opportunities for code splitting
   - Optimize third-party dependencies

2. **Mobile Performance**
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Optimize for low-end devices
   - Reduce time-to-interactive on mobile

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Run accessibility audit
   - Address critical issues
   - Implement keyboard navigation improvements

## Documentation Improvements

1. **API Documentation**
   - Document internal APIs
   - Create service documentation
   - Document state management approach

2. **Component Documentation**
   - Create component usage examples
   - Document props and behaviors
   - Create visual component library

## Project Management

1. **Task Prioritization**
   - Prioritize testing implementation
   - Schedule component refactoring
   - Plan performance optimization work

2. **Timeline**
   - Testing setup: 1 week
   - Initial test implementation: 2 weeks
   - Component refactoring: 2 weeks
   - Performance optimization: 1 week

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-05-30 | Prioritize testing before further refactoring | Testing will help identify issues and ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality |
| 2025-05-30 | Focus on mobile-first testing | The application is primarily focused on mobile users |
| 2025-05-30 | Set up staging environment | To test changes before deploying to production |

## Notes and Considerations

- Testing will help identify areas that need refactoring
- Mobile performance should be a primary consideration in all work
- Component refactoring should follow the mobile-first approach
- Documentation should be updated as components are refactored
