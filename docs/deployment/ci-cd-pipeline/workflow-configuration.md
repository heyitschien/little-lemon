Capstone Project CI/CD Setup with GitHub, Vercel, and GitHub Actions
This document outlines the setup for your capstone project, integrating GitHub, Vercel, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This setup aims to automate your workflow, ensuring code quality and efficient deployment.
1. Tools and Their Purpose
GitHub: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It allows you to manage your project's codebase, track changes, and collaborate with others.
Vercel: A cloud platform for deploying and hosting web applications. It provides automatic deployments, continuous integration, and global CDN for fast performance.
GitHub Actions: A CI/CD service built into GitHub. It allows you to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying your application based on events in your GitHub repository.
2. Workflow Overview
The following workflow describes how these tools will work together:
Feature Development:
Create a new feature branch off the main branch (e.g., feature/new-feature).
Develop the new feature on this branch.
Commit changes to the feature branch.
Pull Request and Testing:
Push the feature branch to GitHub.
Create a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into the staging branch.
GitHub Actions (CI): Upon creating the PR, GitHub Actions will automatically run tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end).
If tests fail, the PR will be blocked, and you'll need to fix the issues.
If tests pass, the PR can be reviewed.
Staging Deployment and Review:
Once the PR is approved and merged into staging, Vercel will automatically deploy the changes to a staging environment (e.g., staging.your-app.vercel.app).
Review the changes in the staging environment to ensure they look and function as expected.
Production Deployment:
Create a pull request to merge the staging branch into the main branch.
GitHub Actions (CI): Optionally, you can configure GitHub Actions to run additional checks or manual approvals before merging into main.
Once the PR is approved and merged into main, Vercel will automatically deploy the changes to the production environment (e.g., your-app.vercel.app).
3. Setting Up the Workflow
GitHub Repository: Ensure you have a GitHub repository set up for your project with main, staging, and feature branches.
Vercel Integration:
Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect your project and set up deployments.
Configure Vercel to create separate deployments for the staging and main branches.
GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository.
Inside this directory, create a YAML file (e.g., ci.yml) to define your CI/CD workflow.
Here's an example of a basic ci.yml file:name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/*
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - staging

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

  deploy-staging:
    needs: build-and-test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/staging'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: npx vercel deploy --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --team-id=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TEAM_ID }} --prod=false


Explanation:
name: The name of the workflow.
on: Defines the events that trigger the workflow (push to feature branches, pull requests to staging).
jobs: Defines the jobs to be executed.
build-and-test: Installs dependencies and runs tests.
deploy-staging: Deploys to Vercel when changes are merged into the staging branch. You'll need to set up Vercel API keys as secrets in your GitHub repository.
Branch Protection Rules: (Highly Recommended)
In your GitHub repository settings, set up branch protection rules for the main branch.
Require pull request reviews before merging.
Require status checks to pass before merging (e.g., the GitHub Actions tests).
This helps prevent accidental pushes of broken code to main.
4. Best Practices
Keep Branches Short-Lived: Feature branches should be merged frequently to avoid large, complex merges.
Write Comprehensive Tests: Ensure you have a good test suite (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to catch regressions and ensure code quality.
Use Environment Variables: Store sensitive information (API keys, etc.) as environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your code.
Monitor Your Pipeline: Regularly check your GitHub Actions workflows and Vercel deployments to ensure everything is running smoothly.
Automate as Much as Possible: The goal of CI/CD is to automate the entire process, from code changes to deployment.
5. Adapting for Local Development
Since you're currently building locally, you can still use this workflow. The main difference is that instead of Vercel deploying to a staging environment, you'll test the changes locally on your development server after the PR is merged into staging.
You can still use GitHub Actions to run tests and enforce code quality before merging into staging and then manually test locally.
This document should provide a solid foundation for setting up your CI/CD pipeline. Remember to adapt it to the specific needs of your project. Good luck!
