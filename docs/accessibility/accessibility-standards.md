# Accessibility Standards and Implementation Guide

## 1. Industry Standards Overview

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance Levels
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define three levels of conformance:

- **Level A**: Minimum level of accessibility
- **Level AA**: Standard level required by most regulations (our target)
- **Level AAA**: Highest level of accessibility

### Key Regulations
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**: Requires businesses to make accommodations for people with disabilities
- **Section 508**: Federal agencies must make their electronic and information technology accessible
- **AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act)**: Canadian standard for accessibility
- **EAA (European Accessibility Act)**: EU directive on accessibility requirements

## 2. Core WCAG Principles (POUR)

### Perceivable
- Text alternatives for non-text content
- Captions and alternatives for multimedia
- Content adaptable and distinguishable

### Operable
- Keyboard accessible functionality
- Sufficient time to read and use content
- No content that causes seizures or physical reactions
- Navigable and locatable content

### Understandable
- Readable and predictable content
- Input assistance and error prevention

### Robust
- Compatible with current and future user tools

## 3. Accessibility Testing in AI-Powered Development Environment

### Automated Testing Integration with WinSurf IDE

#### ESLint with jsx-a11y Plugin
```bash
npm install eslint eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --save-dev
```

Configuration in `.eslintrc.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['jsx-a11y'],
  extends: ['plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended'],
  rules: {
    // Customize rules based on project requirements
    'jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control': ['error', { assert: 'either' }]
  }
}
```

#### React-axe for Development Environment
```bash
npm install react-axe --save-dev
```

Integration in development environment (`src/index.js` or main entry file):
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const axe = require('@axe-core/react');
  const React = require('react');
  const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
  
  axe(React, ReactDOM, 1000);
}
```

#### Automated Testing in CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
npm install @axe-core/cli --save-dev
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test:a11y": "axe http://localhost:3000 --rules wcag2a,wcag2aa"
}
```

### Leveraging AI for Accessibility in WinSurf

1. **AI-Assisted Code Reviews**:
   - Use WinSurf's AI capabilities to review code for accessibility issues
   - Prompt example: "Review this component for WCAG AA compliance"

2. **AI-Generated Accessible Components**:
   - Request accessible versions of UI components
   - Prompt example: "Create an accessible dropdown menu component"

3. **Accessibility Knowledge Integration**:
   - Ask for accessibility best practices for specific scenarios
   - Prompt example: "What's the most accessible way to implement a date picker?"

## 4. Accessibility Testing Workflow

### Development Phase
1. Use ESLint with jsx-a11y to catch issues during coding
2. Leverage WinSurf AI for accessibility-focused code generation
3. Run react-axe in development environment for real-time feedback

### Testing Phase
1. Automated testing with axe-core CLI
2. Manual keyboard navigation testing
3. Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA)

### Pre-Deployment Phase
1. Run comprehensive accessibility audit
2. Document any known issues with remediation plans
3. Ensure all critical accessibility features are functioning

## 5. Mobile-Specific Accessibility Considerations

### Touch Targets
- Minimum size of 44Ã—44 pixels for interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between touch targets

### Gestures
- Simple alternatives for complex gestures
- Avoid reliance on multi-touch gestures

### Orientation
- Support both portrait and landscape orientations
- Do not restrict content to a single orientation

### Screen Readers
- Test with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- Ensure all content is properly announced

## 6. Component-Specific Guidelines

### Forms
- See detailed guidelines in [form-accessibility.md](./form-accessibility.md)

### Navigation
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Skip links for keyboard users
- Clear indication of current location

### Media
- Captions for videos
- Transcripts for audio content
- No auto-playing media

### Interactive Elements
- Clear focus indicators
- Descriptive labels
- Appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
