# DateTimeSelector Component Accessibility Audit

## Overview
This document contains the results of an accessibility audit performed on the DateTimeSelector component, which is a critical part of the Little Lemon reservation system. The audit evaluates the component against WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and identifies areas for improvement.

## Component Description
The DateTimeSelector component allows users to:
- Select a date for their reservation
- Choose an available time slot
- Specify the party size

## Audit Methodology
- Static code analysis using axe Accessibility Linter
- Manual review of component structure and attributes
- Evaluation against WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Audit Findings

### Positive Aspects
1. ✅ Basic form labels are present for all form controls
2. ✅ Error messages are displayed when validation fails
3. ✅ Date input has min/max attributes to prevent invalid selections
4. ✅ Disabled states are properly managed for the time select
5. ✅ Form controls have appropriate visual focus indicators

### Accessibility Issues

#### Critical Issues

1. **Missing ARIA attributes for error messages**
   - Error messages are not programmatically associated with their form controls
   - Missing `aria-describedby` on inputs to link to error messages
   - Error messages lack `role="alert"` to announce changes to screen readers

2. **Focus management issues**
   - Custom date button implementation may trap keyboard focus
   - No visible focus indicator when the hidden date input receives focus

3. **Insufficient color contrast**
   - Error message text color (#EE9972) may not have sufficient contrast against white background

#### Serious Issues

4. **Incomplete form validation announcements**
   - No live region to announce validation errors to screen readers
   - No clear indication when a field becomes valid after being invalid

5. **Missing group labels**
   - No fieldset/legend for the date and time selection group

#### Moderate Issues

6. **Incomplete mobile touch target sizes**
   - Some interactive elements may be smaller than the recommended 44×44px minimum size

7. **Insufficient helper text**
   - Limited instructions for expected date/time formats
   - No clear indication of required fields

## Recommended Fixes

### High Priority

1. **Improve error message accessibility**
   ```jsx
   // Add aria-describedby to inputs
   <input 
     aria-describedby="date-error"
     // other attributes
   />
   <div id="date-error" role="alert" className={styles.errorMessage}>
     {formErrors.date}
   </div>
   ```

2. **Enhance keyboard accessibility**
   - Ensure proper focus management for the custom date picker
   - Add visible focus styles that meet contrast requirements

3. **Fix color contrast issues**
   - Adjust error message color to meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio

### Medium Priority

4. **Add proper ARIA attributes**
   - Add `aria-required="true"` to required fields
   - Use `aria-invalid="true"` when validation fails

5. **Improve form structure**
   - Add fieldset and legend elements to group related controls

### Low Priority

6. **Enhance helper text**
   - Add clear instructions for each form field
   - Indicate required fields with both visual and programmatic indicators

## Conclusion
The DateTimeSelector component has a solid foundation but requires several accessibility improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. The most critical issues involve proper ARIA attributes for error messages, focus management, and color contrast.

## Next Steps
1. Implement high-priority fixes
2. Retest component with axe linter
3. Perform manual testing with keyboard navigation
4. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)
