# Accessibility Implementation Plan: Little Lemon Mobile App

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines our strategic approach to implementing accessibility improvements in the Little Lemon mobile application. Our goal is to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance while creating an inclusive experience for all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

## 2. Current State Assessment

### 2.1 Tools & Infrastructure
- ✅ axe Accessibility Linter installed
- ✅ axe-linter.yml configuration created
- ✅ Documentation framework established

### 2.2 Priority Areas for Assessment
1. Reservation form components
2. Navigation and menu structure
3. Image and media content
4. Color contrast and visual design
5. Keyboard navigation and focus management

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: High-Priority Improvements (Current Sprint)

#### 3.1 Form Accessibility (Reservation System)
The reservation form is a critical user journey and will be our first focus area.

**Tasks:**
1. Audit the `DateTimeSelector` component using axe linter
2. Ensure all form inputs have proper labels and ARIA attributes
3. Implement error handling that meets accessibility standards
4. Test keyboard navigation through the entire form flow
5. Verify screen reader compatibility

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero critical accessibility violations in axe linter
- Complete keyboard navigability
- All form elements properly announced by screen readers
- Error messages properly associated with form fields

#### 3.2 Mobile-Specific Touch Targets
Ensure all interactive elements are properly sized for mobile accessibility.

**Tasks:**
1. Audit all buttons, links, and interactive elements
2. Resize elements to meet the 44×44px minimum requirement
3. Ensure adequate spacing between touch targets
4. Test with various mobile screen sizes

**Success Criteria:**
- All interactive elements meet minimum size requirements
- No accidental activations due to proximity issues
- Consistent touch behavior across the application

### Phase 2: Medium-Priority Improvements (Next Sprint)

#### 3.3 Semantic Structure & Navigation
Ensure proper HTML semantics and navigation patterns.

**Tasks:**
1. Review heading structure across all pages
2. Implement skip links for keyboard users
3. Ensure all custom components have appropriate ARIA roles
4. Test navigation with screen readers

#### 3.4 Color Contrast & Visual Design
Ensure visual elements meet contrast requirements.

**Tasks:**
1. Audit color contrast across the application
2. Adjust color palette where needed
3. Ensure focus indicators are visible
4. Test with color blindness simulators

### Phase 3: Ongoing Improvements

#### 3.5 Automated Testing Integration
Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up axe-core in automated tests
2. Configure GitHub Actions for accessibility checks
3. Establish accessibility reporting dashboard
4. Create documentation for developers

## 4. Implementation Approach for Highest Priority Item

### Form Accessibility Implementation (Reservation System)

#### Step 1: Component Audit
We'll start by auditing the `DateTimeSelector.jsx` component, which is a critical part of our reservation flow.

**Tools:**
- axe Accessibility Linter
- React Testing Library with jest-axe

**Process:**
1. Run axe linter on the component
2. Document all identified issues
3. Categorize by severity (critical, serious, moderate, minor)

#### Step 2: Remediation Plan
For each identified issue:

1. **Research best practice solution**
   - Consult WCAG documentation
   - Review accessibility patterns from trusted sources

2. **Implement fixes**
   - Add proper labels and ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigability
   - Implement proper focus management
   - Associate error messages with form controls

3. **Test changes**
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - Screen reader testing
   - Mobile device testing

#### Step 3: Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
Document all changes and share knowledge with the team:

1. Update component documentation with accessibility considerations
2. Create reusable patterns for similar components
3. Share findings in team knowledge base

## 5. Testing Methodology

### 5.1 Automated Testing
- Unit tests with jest-axe
- Integration tests for user flows
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### 5.2 Manual Testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Zoom/magnification testing
- Mobile device testing

### 5.3 User Testing
- Consider engaging users with disabilities for feedback
- Test with various assistive technologies

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Compliance:** Zero critical or serious accessibility violations
- **Coverage:** 100% of user flows tested for accessibility
- **Performance:** All automated accessibility tests passing in CI/CD
- **Documentation:** Complete accessibility documentation for all components
