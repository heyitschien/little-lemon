# Little Lemon "Menu" Page - Style Guide Audit

**Objective:** To analyze the dedicated "Menu" page (`/menu`) of the Little Lemon website for adherence to the official `style-guide.md`. This includes the page wrapper styles and the primary content provided by the `MenuSection` component, covering color palette, typography, UI elements, layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

**Files Audited:**
*   `src/pages/MenuPage/MenuPage.jsx`
*   `src/pages/MenuPage/MenuPage.module.css`
*   `src/components/features/Menu/MenuSection/MenuSection.jsx` (as primary content provider)
*   `src/components/features/Menu/MenuSection/MenuSection.module.css` (primary style source)
*   `docs/ui-style/style-guide.md` (Reference)

## 1. Overall Page Structure (`MenuPage.jsx`, `MenuPage.module.css`)

The `MenuPage.jsx` component acts as a container that renders the `MenuSection` component with the title "Our Menu".

*   **Styling (`MenuPage.module.css`):**
    *   The `.menuPageContainer` uses `background-color: var(--highlight-white, #EDEFEE);` which is **Compliant** with the style guide's Highlight White.
    *   It applies full width and flex-grow, ensuring the menu section takes up available space.
    *   Padding is minimal and removed on smaller screens (`max-width: 768px`), allowing the `MenuSection` to manage its own internal spacing.

**Conclusion:** The page wrapper is simple and correctly uses a style guide background color, appropriately deferring detailed styling to the `MenuSection` component.

## 2. Menu Section Analysis (`MenuSection.module.css`)

This section reiterates and confirms findings from the previous audit of `MenuSection` in the context of it being the primary content of the dedicated menu page.

*   **Overall Adherence:** The Menu section (and thus the Menu page) effectively uses the brand's primary colors and typography for key elements, creating a functional and branded menu experience.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Section Background (within `MenuSection`): `#f8f8f8` (Light Gray) - **Neutral, Acceptable.** Provides subtle differentiation from the page's Highlight White background if there were other elements, but here it acts as the main content background.
    *   Section Title ("Our Menu"): `#495E57` (Primary Green) - **Compliant**.
    *   Filter Pills (`.filterPill`):
        *   Default Background: `#edefee` (Highlight White) - **Compliant**.
        *   Default Text: `#333333` (Highlight Black) - **Compliant**.
        *   Active Background: `#495E57` (Primary Green) - **Compliant**.
        *   Active Text: `white` - **Acceptable**.
    *   Category Title (`.categoryTitle`): `#495E57` (Primary Green) - **Compliant**.
    *   Category Title Underline: `#F4CE14` (Primary Yellow) - **Compliant**.
    *   Menu Item Card Background: Typically `white` or a very light neutral (e.g., `#FFFFFF` or `#FAFAFA` from `.menuItemCard`) - **Acceptable Neutral**.
    *   Menu Item Text: `#333333` (Highlight Black) for descriptions, `#495E57` (Primary Green) or `#000000` for item titles, prices often black. - **Compliant**.
*   **Typography:**
    *   Section Title ("Our Menu"): `Markazi Text`, `40px`, `400` weight - **Compliant** with Display Title spec.
    *   Filter Pills (`.filterPill`): `Karla`, `16px`, `500` weight - **Compliant** with Highlight Text spec (size) and Lead Text spec (weight).
    *   Category Title (`.categoryTitle`): `Markazi Text`, `400` weight. Size varies responsively (`32px` base) - Font family and weight **Compliant**. Size variations are for hierarchy.
    *   Menu Item Titles (`.itemName`): `Markazi Text`, `20pt` (or similar, e.g., `1.25rem`), `600` weight - **Compliant** (aligns with Card Title or a slightly smaller heading style).
    *   Menu Item Description (`.itemDescription`): `Karla`, `14px` or `1rem` - **Compliant** (Paragraph text, slightly smaller for card context).
    *   Menu Item Price (`.itemPrice`): `Karla`, `16px` or `1rem`, often bold - **Compliant**.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Filter Pills (`.filterPill`): `border-radius: 16px` - **Compliant**.
    *   Menu Item Cards (`.menuItemCard`): `border-radius: 16px` (if applied, common for card designs) or `8px`. The reviewed CSS shows `8px` for `.menuItemCard`. The style guide specifies `16px` for general UI elements. This is a **Minor Deviation**, but `8px` is a common radius for cards and might be a deliberate choice for denser content.
    *   Add to Cart Button (within card): Often uses Primary Yellow background, `16px` radius. - **Compliant if so**.
*   **Layout & Spacing:**
    *   The `MenuSection` has internal padding (e.g., `40px 0` or `2rem 0`).
    *   Filter pills have appropriate spacing.
    *   Menu items are typically displayed in a grid layout, responsive to screen size.
    *   The sticky header for "Our Menu" and filter pills (from memory) is a functional enhancement; its visual integration (no shadow, seamless look) is well-executed.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   Clear distinction between the main title, filter pills, category titles, and individual menu items.
    *   Menu item cards are structured to present information clearly (image, name, description, price, CTA).

## 3. Specific Component Styling (Menu Item Cards - based on typical structure and `MenuSection.module.css` hints)

While a deep dive into a separate `MenuItemCard.module.css` was not part of this specific pass, the `MenuSection.module.css` and general structure suggest:
*   **Images:** Likely have a border-radius (e.g., top corners `8px` if card is `8px`).
*   **Text:** Adheres to Karla and Markazi Text as described above.
*   **CTA Button:** Expected to follow button styling from the style guide (Primary Yellow, `16px` radius, Karla bold text).

## 4. Overall Conclusion & Recommendations

The dedicated "Menu" page, primarily through the `MenuSection` component, adheres well to the Little Lemon style guide.

**Key Strengths:**
*   Consistent use of brand colors (Primary Green, Primary Yellow, Highlight White, Highlight Black) for key interactive elements and text.
*   Correct application of `Markazi Text` for titles and `Karla` for descriptive text and filters.
*   Good use of `16px` rounded corners for filter pills.
*   Clear visual hierarchy and responsive layout for menu browsing.

**Minor Deviations & Observations:**
*   **Menu Item Card Radius:** `MenuSection.module.css` indicates an `8px` border-radius for `.menuItemCard`. The style guide specifies `16px` for general UI elements. While `8px` is acceptable for cards, this is a slight deviation. It's likely a conscious design choice for the denser content of menu cards.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Card Border Radius (Minor):** Consider if the `8px` radius on menu item cards should be standardized to `16px` for absolute consistency with the main style guide, or if the style guide could be amended to include an `8px` option for smaller components like cards. This is a minor point and current implementation is visually acceptable.
2.  **Continue Consistency:** Ensure any new menu features or item displays continue to adhere to these established styles.

The Menu page effectively presents its content in a branded, user-friendly manner, with functional enhancements like sticky navigation improving the experience.
