# Little Lemon Project - Post-Cleanup Action Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the house cleaning process and prepare the project for the next phases of development (unit testing and CI/CD implementation). The goal is to ensure the project is well-organized, properly documented, and follows industry best practices.

## 1. Immediate Actions

These tasks should be completed as part of the current house cleaning phase:

### 1.1 Update README.md

- Update project structure section to reflect the new component organization
- Ensure all directory descriptions are accurate
- Add information about the new component categories (layout, features, common)
- Update installation and setup instructions if needed

### 1.2 Verify Import Paths

- Run the application in development mode to check for console errors
- Perform a grep search for old component names to identify any missed references
- Review key pages to ensure they load correctly
- Fix any broken imports or references

### 1.3 Identify Potential Common Components

- Review existing feature components to identify candidates for common components
- Document components that could be generalized and moved to the common directory
- Prioritize components based on reuse potential

## 2. Short-Term Planning

These tasks should be planned for implementation after the immediate actions:

### 2.1 Component Refactoring

- Plan which components should be moved to common
- Create a migration strategy for each component
- Ensure backward compatibility during refactoring
- Update documentation for refactored components

### 2.2 Component Showcase

- Design a simple component showcase page
- Determine the structure and organization of the showcase
- Plan implementation details (routing, layout, examples)
- Consider future expansion to a more comprehensive storybook

### 2.3 Documentation Updates

- Ensure all design documents reference the new component structure
- Update any component-specific documentation
- Create usage guidelines for common components
- Update house cleaning logs with final results

## 3. Future Work

These tasks should be planned for after the current cleanup phase:

### 3.1 Unit Testing Implementation

- Set up testing framework for components
- Create test plans for key components
- Implement tests for critical functionality
- Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline

### 3.2 CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

- Update GitHub workflow to target correct branches
- Implement auto-merge functionality
- Add linting checks to the pipeline
- Configure deployment pipeline

### 3.3 Component Library Expansion

- Implement identified common components
- Create documentation for each component
- Establish component design patterns and guidelines
- Consider integration with design system

## Branch Strategy

Continue using the `feature/house-cleaning-phase2` branch for immediate actions, then create a new branch (e.g., `feature/component-refactoring`) for short-term planning tasks.

## Success Criteria

The house cleaning process will be considered complete when:

1. All immediate actions are completed
2. Documentation accurately reflects the current project state
3. Project structure follows industry best practices
4. No errors or warnings appear in the console
5. The application functions correctly in all environments
